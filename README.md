# AI Tutor: Intelligent Learning Assistant

This project is a comprehensive AI-powered tutoring application designed to assist users through interactive chat, document analysis, and knowledge exploration. It integrates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for contextual understanding from user-uploaded documents, and knowledge graph capabilities for critical thinking. The system also includes an admin interface for managing shared knowledge resources.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

*   **Node.js**: Version 18.x or later.
*   **npm**: For managing Node.js packages.
*   **Python**: Version 3.9 - 3.11 recommended. Check `server/rag_service/requirements.txt` for specific library compatibility.
*   **pip**: For installing Python packages.
*   **MongoDB**: A running instance for data storage (user accounts, chat history, document metadata).
*   **Docker**: Docker desktop version is required to run the containers(Neo4j & Qdrant)
    *   **Neo4j**: A running instance for graph database (used by the Python RAG service for knowledge graphs).
    *   **Qdrant**: A running instance for vector database (used by the Python RAG service).
*   **Google Gemini API Key** (Mandatory): If you plan to use Google's Gemini models.
*   **Ollama** (Optional): If you plan to use locally hosted Ollama models. Ensure Ollama is installed, running, and accessible.
*   **Tesseract OCR** (Mandatory): For processing image-based documents in the RAG service. Ensure it's installed and the path to the executable is correctly set in `server/rag_service/config.py` (via the `TESSERACT_CMD` environment variable loaded into `server/.env`).

## Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
        git clone `https://github.com/tej-a192/chatbot-Team-2.git`
        cd `chatbot-Team-2`
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (Node.js Server):**
    *   Navigate to the server directory:
        ```bash
            cd server
        ```

    *   Create a `.env` file by copying `server/.env.example` (if it exists) or create it manually. Populate it with your specific configurations:
        ```bash
            PORT=5001
            MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
            JWT_SECRET="your_strong_jwt_secret"
            GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key" # If using Gemini
            PYTHON_RAG_SERVICE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5000" # URL for the Python RAG service
            OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL="http://<ollama_host>:<ollama_port>" # If using Ollama
            OLLAMA_DEFAULT_MODEL="your_default_ollama_model" # e.g., qwen2.5:14b-instruct
            # Add Neo4j connection details if Python service reads them from this .env
            NEO4J_URI="bolt://localhost:7687"
            NEO4J_USERNAME="neo4j_user"
            NEO4J_PASSWORD="password"
            NEO4J_DATABASE="neo4j"
            # Add Qdrant connection details if Python service reads them from this .env
            QDRANT_HOST="localhost"
            QDRANT_PORT=6333
            # Ensure FIXED_ADMIN_USERNAME and FIXED_ADMIN_PASSWORD match frontend/.env for admin login
            FIXED_ADMIN_USERNAME="admin" 
            FIXED_ADMIN_PASSWORD="admin123"
        ```

    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
            npm install
        ```
3. **Tesseract OCR Installation & Setup:**
    * Installation: Follow this guide to install Tesseract OCR
    ```bash
        https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki#tesseract-at-ub-mannheim
    ```

    * Setup : 
    ```bash
        Add the `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR` in the system environment variables
    ```

3.  **Backend Setup (Python RAG & KG Service):**
    *   Navigate to the Python service directory:
        ```bash
            cd server/rag_service
        ```
    *   Install Python dependencies:
        ```bash
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   Ensure `config.py` correctly loads necessary environment variables (it typically reads from `server/.env` via `os.getenv`). Verify paths or settings like `TESSERACT_CMD` if you customized them.
    
    
4.  **Running the Backend (RAG & Node Server):**
    
    *   Run the Docker Containers(Qdrant & Neo4j):  Make sure Docker Desktop is running in the background 
        ```bash
            cd server/rag_service
            docker-compose up -d
        ```
        This command will the run the instances of Qdrant & Neo4j    
    
    *   Run the Python Flask application:
        ```bash
            cd server/rag_service
            python app.py
        ```
        This service will typically run on port 5000 (as configured by `PYTHON_RAG_SERVICE_URL` in `server/.env` and `API_PORT` in `server/rag_service/config.py`).
    
    *   Start the Node.js backend:
        ```bash
            cd server
            npm start 
        ```
        The server will typically run on the port specified in your `server/.env` file (e.g., `http://localhost:5001`).


5.  **Frontend Setup:**
    *   Navigate to the frontend directory:
        ```bash
            cd frontend
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file. You can copy `frontend/.env.example` if available, or create one based on the provided `frontend/.env` content:
        ```bash
            VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001/api # Should match your Node.js backend API URL
            VITE_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
            VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
            npm install
        ```
6.  **Running the Frontend:**
    *   Start the frontend development server:
        ```bash
            cd frontend
            npm run dev
        ```
        The frontend will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port indicated by Vite).

5.  **Running the Full Application:**
    *   Ensure MongoDB, Qdrant, and Neo4j services are running.
    *   If using Ollama, ensure it's running and accessible.
    *   Start the Python RAG & KG Service (`server/rag_service/app.py`).
    *   Start the Node.js Backend Server (`server/server.js`).
    *   Start the Frontend Development Server (`cd frontend && npm run dev`).
    *   Access the application through the frontend URL provided by Vite.
