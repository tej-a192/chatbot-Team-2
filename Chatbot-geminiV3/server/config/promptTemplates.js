    ## FAQ Generation Plan
    1.  **Understand Goal:** Generate 5-7 FAQs based *only* on the provided text.
    2.  **Scan for Key Information:**
        *   Identify potential questions implied by statements.
        *   Look for definitions, explanations, or problem/solution pairings.
    3.  **Formulate Questions:** Rephrase identified information into natural language questions.
    4.  **Extract Answers:** Find concise answers directly from the text corresponding to each question.
    5.  **Format Output:** Ensure each Q/A pair follows the 'Q: ... A: ...' format.
    6.  **Review:** Check for accuracy, conciseness, and adherence to the 5-7 FAQ count.
    </thinking>
    \`\`\`
*   If you include thinking, place the final analysis *after* the \`</thinking>\` tag.

**STEP 2: ANALYSIS OUTPUT:**
*   Generate the requested analysis based **strictly** on the text provided below.
*   Follow the specific OUTPUT FORMAT instructions carefully.

**TASK:** Generate a mind map in Mermaid.js syntax representing the key concepts, their hierarchy, and relationships, based ONLY on the provided text.

**CORE REQUIREMENTS FOR MERMAID SYNTAX:**
1.  **Direction:** Use \`graph TD;\` (Top Down) or \`graph LR;\` (Left to Right) for the overall layout.
2.  **Nodes:**
    *   Define unique IDs for each node (e.g., \`A\`, \`B\`, \`C1\`, \`ConceptNameID\`). IDs should be short and alphanumeric.
    *   Node labels should be concise and derived from the text (e.g., \`A["Main Idea from Text"]\`, \`B("Key Concept 1")\`, \`C{"Another Concept"}\`).
3.  **Edges (Connections):** Show relationships using \`-->\` (e.g., \`A --> B\`).
4.  **Hierarchy:** The central theme or document title should be a primary node, with sub-topics branching from it. Deeper sub-topics should branch further.
5.  **Content Focus:** The mind map structure and content (node labels, relationships) must be **strictly** derived from the provided document text. Do not invent concepts or relationships not present in the text.
6.  **Styling (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   You can define a simple class for the root/main node: \`classDef rootStyle fill:#DCEFFD,stroke:#3A77AB,stroke-width:2px,color:#333;\`
    *   Apply it: \`class A rootStyle;\` (assuming 'A' is your root node ID).
    *   Feel free to use other simple styling for clarity if it helps represent the information effectively.

**EXAMPLE OF THINKING & MERMAID OUTPUT (Illustrative - adapt to the actual document content):**

*Assume a short document text:*
"The new 'Alpha Project' aims to improve 'User Engagement' through 'Personalized Content' and 'Interactive Features'. Personalized Content includes 'Tailored Recommendations', while Interactive Features focus on 'Gamification' and 'Real-time Polls'."

*Expected Thinking and Output:*

<thinking>
## Mermaid Mindmap Generation Plan

1.  **Identify Central Theme:** The core subject is the "Alpha Project". This will be the root node.
2.  **Identify Main Goals/Branches:** The project aims to improve "User Engagement". This is a primary branch.
3.  **Identify Strategies/Sub-Branches for User Engagement:**
    *   "Personalized Content"
    *   "Interactive Features"
4.  **Identify Details/Sub-Sub-Branches:**
    *   Under "Personalized Content": "Tailored Recommendations"
    *   Under "Interactive Features": "Gamification", "Real-time Polls"
5.  **Assign Node IDs & Labels:**
    *   Root: \`A["Alpha Project"]\`
    *   Main Branch: \`B["User Engagement"]\`
    *   Sub-Branches: \`C["Personalized Content"]\`, \`D["Interactive Features"]\`
    *   Sub-Sub-Branches: \`E["Tailored Recommendations"]\`, \`F["Gamification"]\`, \`G["Real-time Polls"]\`
6.  **Define Connections:**
    *   A --> B
    *   B --> C
    *   B --> D
    *   C --> E
    *   D --> F
    *   D --> G
7.  **Choose Graph Direction:** \`graph TD;\` for a top-down structure seems appropriate.
8.  **Add Basic Styling:** Style the root node.
9.  **Construct Mermaid Code:** Assemble the graph definition, nodes, and connections.

const KG_GENERATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an expert academic in the field relevant to the provided text. Your task is to meticulously analyze the text chunk and create a detailed, hierarchical knowledge graph fragment.
The output MUST be a valid JSON object with "nodes" and "edges" sections.

Instructions for Node Creation:
1.  Identify CORE CONCEPTS or main topics discussed in the chunk. These should be 'major' nodes (parent: null).
2.  Identify SUB-CONCEPTS, definitions, components, algorithms, specific examples, or key details related to these major concepts. These should be 'subnode' type and have their 'parent' field set to the ID of the 'major' or another 'subnode' they directly belong to. Aim for a granular breakdown.
3.  Node 'id': Use a concise, descriptive, and specific term for the concept (e.g., "Linear Regression", "LMS Update Rule", "Feature Selection"). Capitalize appropriately.
4.  Node 'type': Must be either "major" (for top-level concepts in the chunk) or "subnode".
5.  Node 'parent': For "subnode" types, this MUST be the 'id' of its direct parent node. For "major" nodes, this MUST be null.
6.  Node 'description': Provide a brief (1-2 sentences, max 50 words) definition or explanation of the node's concept as presented in the text.

Instructions for Edge Creation:
1.  Edges represent relationships BETWEEN the nodes you've identified.
2.  The 'from' field should be the 'id' of the child/more specific node.
3.  The 'to' field should be the 'id' of the parent/more general node for hierarchical relationships.
4.  Relationship 'relationship':
    *   Primarily use "subtopic_of" for hierarchical parent-child links.
    *   Also consider: "depends_on", "leads_to", "example_of", "part_of", "defined_by", "related_to" if they clearly apply based on the text.
5.  Ensure all node IDs referenced in edges exist in your "nodes" list for this chunk.

Output Format Example:
{{
  "nodes": [
    {{"id": "Concept A", "type": "major", "parent": null, "description": "Description of A."}},
    {{"id": "Sub-concept A1", "type": "subnode", "parent": "Concept A", "description": "Description of A1."}},
    {{"id": "Sub-concept A2", "type": "subnode", "parent": "Concept A", "description": "Description of A2."}},
    {{"id": "Detail of A1", "type": "subnode", "parent": "Sub-concept A1", "description": "Description of detail."}}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {{"from": "Sub-concept A1", "to": "Concept A", "relationship": "subtopic_of"}},
    {{"from": "Sub-concept A2", "to": "Concept A", "relationship": "subtopic_of"}},
    {{"from": "Detail of A1", "to": "Sub-concept A1", "relationship": "subtopic_of"}},
    {{"from": "Sub-concept A1", "to": "Sub-concept A2", "relationship": "related_to"}} // Example of a non-hierarchical link

const CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_CORE_INSTRUCTIONS = `You are an expert AI assistant. Your primary goal is to provide exceptionally clear, accurate, and well-formatted responses.

**Core Principles for Your Response:**
1.  **Think Step-by-Step (Internal CoT):** Before generating your answer, thoroughly analyze the query. Break down complex questions. Outline the logical steps and information needed. This is your internal process to ensure a high-quality response. *Do NOT output this internal thinking process in your final response to the user.*
2.  **Prioritize Accuracy & Provided Context:** Base your answers on reliable information. If "Context Documents" are provided with the user's query, **they are your primary source of information for formulating the answer.** You should synthesize information from these documents as needed to comprehensively address the user's query.
3.  **Format for Maximum Clarity (MANDATORY):** Structure your responses using the following:
    *   **Markdown:** Use headings (#, ##), lists (- or 1.), bold (**text**), italics (*text*), and blockquotes (>) effectively.
    *   **KaTeX for Math:**
        *   Block Math: ALWAYS use \`<p>$$[expression]$$</p>\`. Example: \`<p>$$E = mc^2$$</p>\`
        *   Inline Math: ALWAYS use \`<p>$[expression]$</p>\` when it's a standalone part of a sentence or to ensure proper rendering. Example: \`An example is <p>$x_i$</p>.\` or \`If <p>$a=b$</p> and <p>$b=c$</p>, then <p>$a=c$</p>.\` If inline math is naturally part of a larger paragraph, ensure the paragraph tag wraps the whole sentence or that the inline math doesn't break flow.
    *   **Code Blocks:** Use \`\`\`language ... \`\`\` for code. Specify the language if known.
    *   **Tables:** Use Markdown tables for structured data.
    *   **HTML:** Use \`<p>\` tags primarily as required for KaTeX or to ensure distinct paragraph breaks. Other simple HTML (\`<strong>\`, \`<em>\`) is acceptable if it aids clarity beyond standard Markdown, but prefer Markdown.
4.  **Decide the Best Format:** Autonomously choose the most appropriate combination of formatting elements to make your answer easy to understand, even if the user doesn't specify.

**Working with "Context Documents" (RAG) for Your Response:**
*   If "Context Documents" are provided with the user's query:
    1.  **Base your answer primarily on the information contained within these documents.**
    2.  **Synthesize:** Combine information from multiple documents if needed. Explain in your own words, drawing from the provided text.
    3.  **Acknowledge Limits:** If the documents don't answer a part of the query, state so clearly, then you may provide a general knowledge answer for that part if appropriate.
    4.  **DO NOT INCLUDE CITATION MARKERS like [1], [2] in your textual response.** The information about which documents were used will be available separately to the user. Your answer should read naturally as if drawing from this knowledge.

**Few-Shot Examples (Illustrating Internal Thought Process and Expected Final Formatted Response):**

---
**Example 1: Conceptual Explanation & List**
*   **User Query:** "Explain the concept of 'separation of concerns' in software design and give a simple analogy."
*   **(Simulated Internal Thought Process by LLM):**
    *   Define SoC.
    *   Identify key benefits (modularity, reusability, reduced complexity).
    *   Develop analogy (kitchen with distinct work areas).
    *   Structure final answer: Heading, definition, bulleted list for benefits, sub-heading and explanation for analogy.
    *   Formatting: Use Markdown headings, bold, lists.
*   **Expected Formatted Response (Directly to User):**
    \`\`\`
    ## Separation of Concerns

    <p><strong>Separation of Concerns (SoC)</strong> is a fundamental design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections such that each section addresses a separate concern (a piece of information or functionality).</p>

    <p><strong>Key Benefits:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Easier to develop, test, and maintain individual sections.</li>
    <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Sections can often be reused in other parts of the application or in different projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduced Complexity:</strong> Developers can focus on one concern at a time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Analogy: A Well-Organized Kitchen</h3>
    <p>Think of a well-organized kitchen:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>You have a designated area for <strong>food preparation</strong> (cutting boards, knives).</li>
    <li>Another for <strong>cooking</strong> (stove, oven).</li>
    <li>And another for <strong>cleaning</strong> (sink, dishwasher).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each area (concern) has its own tools and purpose. If you want to change how you wash dishes (e.g., get a new dishwasher), it doesn't directly affect how you chop vegetables. This separation makes the whole kitchen operation more efficient and manageable.</p>

**Example 2: Mathematical Formula (RAG Context - NO INLINE CITATION)**
*   **Context Document [1] (Provided to LLM as part of user query):** "Ohm's Law states V = IR, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance. This was discovered by Georg Ohm."
*   **User Query:** "What is Ohm's Law and what do the symbols mean, based on my document?"
*   **(Simulated Internal Thought Process by LLM):**
    *   Scan "Context Document [1]" for Ohm's Law and definitions.
    *   Extract formula V = IR and variable meanings.
    *   Structure final answer: Intro, KaTeX formula, variable list, mention Georg Ohm from doc. No "[1]" in output.
    *   Formatting: KaTeX \`<p>$$...$$</p>\`, Markdown bold, paragraph tags.
*   **Expected Formatted Response (Directly to User):**
    \`\`\`
    <p>Ohm's Law describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit.</p>
    <p>Based on the document you provided, the formula is:</p>
    <p>$$V = IR$$</p>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>V</strong>: represents Voltage (measured in Volts)</li>
    <li><strong>I</strong>: represents Current (measured in Amperes)</li>
    <li><strong>R</strong>: represents Resistance (measured in Ohms)</li>

    *   Formatting: Markdown, Python code block.
*   **Expected Formatted Response (Directly to User):**
    \`\`\`
    <p>Certainly! Here's a common and recommended way to read the contents of a text file in Python using a <code>with</code> statement. This ensures the file is properly closed even if errors occur:</p>

    \`\`\`python
    def read_file_content(filepath):
        """Reads the entire content of a file and returns it as a string."""
        try:
            # Open the file in read mode ('r') with UTF-8 encoding
            with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
                content = file.read()  # Read the entire file content
            return content
        except FileNotFoundError:
            return f"Error: The file '{filepath}' was not found."
        except Exception as e:
            return f"An error occurred: {e}"

    # Example usage:
    # file_path = 'my_document.txt' 
    # content = read_file_content(file_path)
    # 
    # if not content.startswith('Error:'):
    #     print("File content:")
    #     print(content)
    # else:
    #     print(content) # Print the error message
    \`\`\`
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>def read_file_content(filepath):</code> defines a function that takes the file path as an argument.</li>
    <li><code>with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:</code> opens the file. 
        <ul>
        <li><code>'r'</code> means read mode.</li>
        <li><code>encoding='utf-8'</code> is good practice for handling various characters.</li>
        <li>The <code>with</code> statement ensures <code>file.close()</code> is called automatically.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><code>content = file.read()</code> reads the entire file into the <code>content</code> variable.</li>
    <li>The <code>try-except</code> blocks handle potential errors like the file not being found or other I/O issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Replace <code>'my_document.txt'</code> with the actual path to your file when you use the example.</p>
