✈️ Who Is Maverick?
Captain Pete "Maverick" Mitchell is a fictional U.S. Navy fighter pilot and the main character in the Top Gun movies, portrayed by Tom Cruise. Maverick is known for:

His fearless flying

His rebel attitude

His loyalty to his wingmen

And a deep, unshakeable belief in flying by instinct

🎬 Top Gun (1986) – The Rise of a Legend
The first Top Gun movie introduced Maverick as a hotshot pilot with unmatched talent — and a serious attitude problem. He gets sent to the Navy's elite Fighter Weapons School, aka Top Gun, where only the best of the best are trained.

Maverick often clashes with rules and his rival, Iceman, but proves himself in a crisis. He's haunted by the death of his best friend and Radar Intercept Officer, Goose, which deeply humbles him. By the end, Maverick matures and chooses to stay in the Navy, ready to mentor others.

🛩️ Top Gun: Maverick (2022) – The Return of a Hero
In the sequel, over 30 years later, Maverick is still flying — not a general, not an admiral, just a captain, because he refuses to stop doing what he loves: flying fast and pushing limits.

He's called back to Top Gun to train a new generation of pilots for a deadly mission. One of them is Rooster, Goose's son. Tension runs high, past wounds reopen, but Maverick proves once again that experience and heart still matter in a world dominated by drones and tech.
