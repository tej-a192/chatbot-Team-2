The MERN stack is a popular technology stack for building full-stack web applications. It consists of four key components. MongoDB is a NoSQL database used for the data layer. Express.js is a backend web application framework that runs on top of Node.js. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces on the frontend. Finally, Node.js is the JavaScript runtime environment that allows Express to run on the server. The primary relationship is that React handles the client-side, while Express.js provides the server-side API.
