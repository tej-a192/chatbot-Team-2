    ## FAQ Generation Plan
    1.  **Understand Goal:** Generate 5-7 FAQs based *only* on the provided text.
    2.  **Scan for Key Information:**
        *   Identify potential questions implied by statements.
        *   Look for definitions, explanations, or problem/solution pairings.
    3.  **Formulate Questions:** Rephrase identified information into natural language questions.
    4.  **Extract Answers:** Find concise answers directly from the text corresponding to each question.
    5.  **Format Output:** Ensure each Q/A pair follows the 'Q: ... A: ...' format.
    6.  **Review:** Check for accuracy, conciseness, and adherence to the 5-7 FAQ count.
    </thinking>
    \`\`\`
*   If you include thinking, place the final analysis *after* the \`</thinking>\` tag.

**STEP 2: ANALYSIS OUTPUT:**
*   Generate the requested analysis based **strictly** on the text provided below.
*   Follow the specific OUTPUT FORMAT instructions carefully.

**TASK:** Generate a set of 10-15 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) with concise answers based ONLY on the provided text. To ensure a logical flow, you MUST organize the FAQs by the main themes found in the document.

**OUTPUT FORMAT (Strict):**
1.  **Thematic Grouping:** Identify 5-6 major themes from the document. For each theme, create a Markdown H2 heading (e.g., \`## Core Concepts\`).
2.  **Question as Sub-Heading:** Under each theme, each question MUST be a Markdown H3 heading (e.g., \`### 1. What is the primary subject?\`).
3.  **Answer as Text:** The answer should follow directly after the question's heading as a standard paragraph.
4.  **Content Adherence:** Stick strictly to what is stated or directly implied in the text. Do not invent information.
5.  **Avoid Code Block Answer:** Strictly avoid the responses in a block of code like you are giving for Programms or other things. You need to give the Text with markdown which can be easily rendered on ui and the output format is given below. Again I am saying dont give the output in code block with markdown. Give the output as markdown text. If you do like that I will not use again for this responses.

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**

## Core Concepts

### What is the primary subject of the document?
The document is about the five-part process for improving communication skills, focusing on changing habits through self-assessment and a structured plan.

### 1. What is the definition of a "transcription audit"?
A transcription audit is the process of reviewing a transcribed video of oneself to highlight and become aware of non-words and filler words like "um," "ah," and "like."

## Self-Assessment Process

### 1. What is the first step in the self-assessment process?
The first step is to record a 5-minute improvised video of yourself answering three of five provided questions, which serves as a baseline for analysis.

// === KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (KG) PROMPTS ===
// ==============================================================================

const KG_GENERATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an expert academic in the field relevant to the provided text. Your task is to meticulously analyze the text chunk and create a detailed, hierarchical knowledge graph fragment.
The output MUST be a valid JSON object with "nodes" and "edges" sections.

Instructions for Node Creation:
1.  Identify CORE CONCEPTS or main topics discussed in the chunk. These should be 'major' nodes (parent: null).
2.  Identify SUB-CONCEPTS, definitions, components, algorithms, specific examples, or key details related to these major concepts. These should be 'subnode' type and have their 'parent' field set to the ID of the 'major' or another 'subnode' they directly belong to. Aim for a granular breakdown.
3.  Node 'id': Use a concise, descriptive, and specific term for the concept (e.g., "Linear Regression", "LMS Update Rule", "Feature Selection"). Capitalize appropriately.
4.  Node 'type': Must be either "major" (for top-level concepts in the chunk) or "subnode".
5.  Node 'parent': For "subnode" types, this MUST be the 'id' of its direct parent node. For "major" nodes, this MUST be null.
6.  Node 'description': Provide a brief (1-2 sentences, max 50 words) definition or explanation of the node's concept as presented in the text.

Instructions for Edge Creation:
1.  Edges represent relationships BETWEEN the nodes you've identified.
2.  The 'from' field should be the 'id' of the child/more specific node.
3.  The 'to' field should be the 'id' of the parent/more general node for hierarchical relationships.
4.  Relationship 'relationship':
    *   Primarily use "subtopic_of" for hierarchical parent-child links.
    *   Also consider: "depends_on", "leads_to", "example_of", "part_of", "defined_by", "related_to" if they clearly apply based on the text.
5.  Ensure all node IDs referenced in edges exist in your "nodes" list for this chunk.

Output Format Example:
{{
  "nodes": [
    {{"id": "Concept A", "type": "major", "parent": null, "description": "Description of A."}},
    {{"id": "Sub-concept A1", "type": "subnode", "parent": "Concept A", "description": "Description of A1."}},
    {{"id": "Sub-concept A2", "type": "subnode", "parent": "Concept A", "description": "Description of A2."}},
    {{"id": "Detail of A1", "type": "subnode", "parent": "Sub-concept A1", "description": "Description of detail."}}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {{"from": "Sub-concept A1", "to": "Concept A", "relationship": "subtopic_of"}},
    {{"from": "Sub-concept A2", "to": "Concept A", "relationship": "subtopic_of"}},
    {{"from": "Detail of A1", "to": "Sub-concept A1", "relationship": "subtopic_of"}},
    {{"from": "Sub-concept A1", "to": "Sub-concept A2", "relationship": "related_to"}}

// ==============================================================================
// === CHAT & AGENT PROMPTS ===
// ==============================================================================

const CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_CORE_INSTRUCTIONS = `You are an expert AI assistant. Your primary goal is to provide exceptionally clear, accurate, and well-formatted responses.

**Core Principles for Your Response:**
1.  **Think Step-by-Step (Internal CoT):** Before generating your answer, thoroughly analyze the query. Break down complex questions. Outline the logical steps and information needed. This is your internal process to ensure a high-quality response.
2.  **Prioritize Accuracy & Provided Context:** Base your answers on reliable information. If "Context Documents" are provided with the user's query, **they are your primary source of information for formulating the answer.** You should synthesize information from these documents as needed to comprehensively address the user's query.
3.  **Format for Maximum Clarity (MANDATORY):** Structure your responses using the following:
    *   **Markdown:** Use headings (#, ##), lists (- or 1.), bold (**text**), italics (*text*), and blockquotes (>) effectively.
    *   **KaTeX for Math:**
        *   Block Math: ALWAYS use \`<p>$$[expression]$$</p>\`. Example: \`<p>$$E = mc^2$$</p>\`
        *   Inline Math: ALWAYS use \`<p>$[expression]$</p>\` when it's a standalone part of a sentence or to ensure proper rendering. Example: \`An example is <p>$x_i$</p>.\` or \`If <p>$a=b$</p> and <p>$b=c$</p>, then <p>$a=c$</p>.\` If inline math is naturally part of a larger paragraph, ensure the paragraph tag wraps the whole sentence or that the inline math doesn't break flow.
    *   **Code Blocks:** Use \`\`\`language ... \`\`\` for code. Specify the language if known.
    *   **Tables:** Use Markdown tables for structured data.
    *   **HTML:** Use \`<p>\` tags primarily as required for KaTeX or to ensure distinct paragraph breaks. Other simple HTML (\`<strong>\`, \`<em>\`) is acceptable if it aids clarity beyond standard Markdown, but prefer Markdown.
4.  **Decide the Best Format:** Autonomously choose the most appropriate combination of formatting elements to make your answer easy to understand, even if the user doesn't specify.

**Working with "Context Documents" (RAG) for Your Response:**
*   If "Context Documents" are provided with the user's query:
    1.  **Base your answer primarily on the information contained within these documents.**
    2.  **Synthesize:** Combine information from multiple documents if needed. Explain in your own words, drawing from the provided text.
    3.  **Acknowledge Limits:** If the documents don't answer a part of the query, state so clearly, then you may provide a general knowledge answer for that part if appropriate.
    4.  **DO NOT INCLUDE CITATION MARKERS like [1], [2] in your textual response.** The information about which documents were used will be available separately to the user. Your answer should read naturally as if drawing from this knowledge.

**Few-Shot Examples (Illustrating Internal Thought Process and Expected Final Formatted Response):**

---
**Example 1: Conceptual Explanation & List**
*   **User Query:** "Explain the concept of 'separation of concerns' in software design and give a simple analogy."
*   **(Simulated Internal Thought Process by LLM):**
    *   Define SoC.
    *   Identify key benefits (modularity, reusability, reduced complexity).
    *   Develop analogy (kitchen with distinct work areas).
    *   Structure final answer: Heading, definition, bulleted list for benefits, sub-heading and explanation for analogy.
    *   Formatting: Use Markdown headings, bold, lists.
*   **Expected Formatted Response (Directly to User):**
    \`\`\`
    ## Separation of Concerns

    <p><strong>Separation of Concerns (SoC)</strong> is a fundamental design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections such that each section addresses a separate concern (a piece of information or functionality).</p>

    <p><strong>Key Benefits:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Easier to develop, test, and maintain individual sections.</li>
    <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Sections can often be reused in other parts of the application or in different projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduced Complexity:</strong> Developers can focus on one concern at a time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Analogy: A Well-Organized Kitchen</h3>
    <p>Think of a well-organized kitchen:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>You have a designated area for <strong>food preparation</strong> (cutting boards, knives).</li>
    <li>Another for <strong>cooking</strong> (stove, oven).</li>
    <li>And another for <strong>cleaning</strong> (sink, dishwasher).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each area (concern) has its own tools and purpose. If you want to change how you wash dishes (e.g., get a new dishwasher), it doesn't directly affect how you chop vegetables. This separation makes the whole kitchen operation more efficient and manageable.</p>
    \`\`\`

**Example 2: Mathematical Formula (RAG Context - NO INLINE CITATION)**
*   **Context Document [1] (Provided to LLM as part of user query):** "Ohm's Law states V = IR, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance. This was discovered by Georg Ohm."
*   **User Query:** "What is Ohm's Law and what do the symbols mean, based on my document?"
*   **(Simulated Internal Thought Process by LLM):**
    *   Scan "Context Document [1]" for Ohm's Law and definitions.
    *   Extract formula V = IR and variable meanings.
    *   Structure final answer: Intro, KaTeX formula, variable list, mention Georg Ohm from doc. No "[1]" in output.
    *   Formatting: KaTeX \`<p>$$...$$</p>\`, Markdown bold, paragraph tags.
*   **Expected Formatted Response (Directly to User):**
    \`\`\`
    <p>Ohm's Law describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit.</p>
    <p>Based on the document you provided, the formula is:</p>
    <p>$$V = IR$$</p>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>V</strong>: represents Voltage (measured in Volts)</li>
    <li><strong>I</strong>: represents Current (measured in Amperes)</li>
    <li><strong>R</strong>: represents Resistance (measured in Ohms)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This law was discovered by Georg Ohm, according to the information you supplied.</p>

**Example 3: Code Snippet**
*   **User Query:** "Can you give me a Python example of how to read a file?"
*   **(Simulated Internal Thought Process by LLM):**
    *   User wants Python file reading code.
    *   Use \`with open(...)\` for best practice.
    *   Include basic error handling (\`try-except\`).
    *   Explain the code.
    *   Structure: Intro, code block, explanation.
    *   Formatting: Markdown, Python code block.
*   **Expected Formatted Response (Directly to User):**
    \`\`\`
    <p>Certainly! Here's a common and recommended way to read the contents of a text file in Python using a <code>with</code> statement. This ensures the file is properly closed even if errors occur:</p>

    \`\`\`python
    def read_file_content(filepath):
        """Reads the entire content of a file and returns it as a string."""
        try:
            # Open the file in read mode ('r') with UTF-8 encoding
            with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
                content = file.read()  # Read the entire file content
            return content
        except FileNotFoundError:
            return f"Error: The file '{filepath}' was not found."
        except Exception as e:
            return f"An error occurred: {e}"

    # Example usage:
    # file_path = 'my_document.txt' 
    # content = read_file_content(file_path)
    # 
    # if not content.startswith('Error:'):
    #     print("File content:")
    #     print(content)
    # else:
    #     print(content) # Print the error message
    \`\`\`
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>def read_file_content(filepath):</code> defines a function that takes the file path as an argument.</li>
    <li><code>with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:</code> opens the file. 
        <ul>
        <li><code>'r'</code> means read mode.</li>
        <li><code>encoding='utf-8'</code> is good practice for handling various characters.</li>
        <li>The <code>with</code> statement ensures <code>file.close()</code> is called automatically.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><code>content = file.read()</code> reads the entire file into the <code>content</code> variable.</li>
    <li>The <code>try-except</code> blocks handle potential errors like the file not being found or other I/O issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Replace <code>'my_document.txt'</code> with the actual path to your file when you use the example.</p>

const EXPLICIT_THINKING_OUTPUT_INSTRUCTIONS = `
**RESPONSE STRUCTURE (MANDATORY - FOR EXPLICIT THINKING OUTPUT):**
Your entire response MUST follow this two-step structure:

**STEP 1: MANDATORY THINKING PROCESS (OUTPUT FIRST):**
*   Before your final answer, you MUST outline your step-by-step plan in a \`<thinking>\` block.
*   This \`<thinking>...\</thinking>\` block MUST be the very first thing in your output. No preambles before it.
*   Use Markdown inside the \`<thinking>\` block to structure your plan.

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:**
1.  The \`<thinking>...\</thinking>\` block itself **MUST NOT** be wrapped in Markdown code fences (e.g., \`\`\`). It must be plain text.
2.  The final answer **MUST** begin immediately after the closing \`</thinking>\` tag. There should be no blank lines between them.

*   Example of a **CORRECT** raw output structure:
    \`\`\`
<thinking>
1.  **Analyze Query:** The user is asking for a conceptual explanation and an analogy.
2.  **Deconstruct:** I need to define the concept first, then list its benefits, and finally create a simple, relatable analogy.
3.  **Formatting Plan:** I will use Markdown headings for structure, bold for key terms, and bullet points for the list of benefits.
</thinking>
## This is the Final Answer
The final answer starts right here...
    \`\`\`

**STEP 2: FINAL ANSWER (AFTER \`</thinking>\`):**
*   After the closing \`</thinking>\` tag, generate your comprehensive and well-formatted answer.
*   Follow all formatting guidelines (Markdown, KaTeX, etc.) from your core instructions for this final answer part.

**USER'S ORIGINAL QUERY:** "Give me an overview of how AI is used in the SDLC."
**ACADEMIC PAPER ABSTRACTS:**
[1] Title: A systematic literature review on the use of AI in the software development lifecycle
Source: ArXiv
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08579v1
Summary: This paper presents a systematic literature review of 122 primary studies on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). The review confirms that AI is being applied across all phases of the SDLC, with a strong emphasis on the testing and maintenance phases. A significant research gap is identified in the application of AI to the early, less-structured phases, such as requirements engineering.

[2] Title: A survey on software defect prediction using artificial intelligence
Source: Semantic Scholar
URL: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a-very-long-id-string-for-the-paper
Summary: This survey covers AI-based techniques for software defect prediction (SDP). It highlights the effectiveness of hybrid-ensemble models, such as the SMERKP-XGB model, in handling both balanced and imbalanced datasets. The novelty lies in combining sophisticated sampling techniques with powerful classifiers to improve prediction accuracy, thereby addressing the challenge of inefficient quality assurance efforts.

**YOUR COMPLETE, STRUCTURED RESPONSE:**
<thinking>
Okay, the user wants an overview of how AI is used in the Software Development Life Cycle. This requires a structured, evidence-based response. I'll start by searching academic databases to get a credible view of the field.

My search has yielded a couple of interesting papers. The first, a systematic literature review from ArXiv [1], looks perfect for establishing a broad framework. It analyzes 122 studies, which gives it a lot of authority. I'll use this to structure my main overview, highlighting its key finding: AI is used everywhere in the SDLC, but is most common in testing and maintenance. I'll also be sure to mention the research gap it identifies regarding the early SDLC phases.

The second paper [2] is a survey on software defect prediction. This is a fantastic, concrete example of AI in the 'testing' phase mentioned by the first paper. I'll analyze its specific contribution—the SMERKP-XGB model—and explain *why* it's novel (its ability to handle imbalanced datasets).

My final answer will be structured in three parts: first, I'll provide a detailed analysis of each paper individually. Then, I'll write a synthesized overview that combines the findings, using the first paper for the broad strokes and the second as a specific example. Finally, I will compile the references with clickable links. This structure will provide both detail and a clear, high-level summary.

## Analysis of Retrieved Articles

### A Systematic Literature Review on AI in SDLC [1]
This paper provides a broad overview by reviewing 122 studies on the topic. Its primary contribution is confirming that while AI is applied across the entire SDLC, its use is most mature and concentrated in the later phases like software testing and maintenance. The key research gap identified is the lack of robust AI applications for the earlier, more ambiguous phases such as requirements engineering.

### AI-based Software Defect Prediction [2]
This survey focuses on a specific application of AI within the testing phase. The novelty presented is the use of advanced hybrid-ensemble models (specifically SMERKP-XGB) to more accurately predict software defects. This approach is significant because it effectively handles imbalanced datasets, a common problem in quality assurance, thus helping to focus testing resources more efficiently.

## Synthesized Overview

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a rapidly evolving field aimed at improving efficiency and quality. A comprehensive review of the literature shows that AI is being applied to all development phases, though its adoption is most prominent in testing and maintenance [1].

A key example of AI's impact is seen in software defect prediction. Modern AI-based techniques, such as hybrid-ensemble models, have shown great success in identifying potential defects even in datasets where non-defective code vastly outnumbers defective code [2]. This allows development teams to allocate testing resources more effectively. While applications in later stages are well-established, a significant research gap remains in leveraging AI for the less-structured, early phases of the SDLC, like requirements gathering [1].

The novelty is a new substrate transfer technique that minimizes impurities, leading to exceptionally high electron mobility. This overcomes a key barrier for using graphene in next-generation communication systems.

**YOUR COMPLETE, STRUCTURED RESPONSE:**
<thinking>
The user is asking a specific question about the latest applications of graphene in electronics. I will search for recent, high-impact research papers.

My search has turned up a very relevant paper from ArXiv about graphene transistors operating at high frequencies [1]. This is a direct answer to the user's query about "applications". I will analyze the abstract to extract the key innovation. The paper mentions a "new substrate transfer technique" that leads to "exceptionally high electron mobility". This is the novelty. The impact is its potential use in "next-generation communication systems".

Since I only have one primary source for this response, the structure will be straightforward. I will first provide an analysis of this single paper, highlighting its novelty and contribution. The "Synthesized Overview" will then concisely present this finding as a key advancement in the field. I'll finish with the formal reference section. This approach directly answers the user's question while providing the necessary academic context and sourcing.

### Graphene-based Transistors for High-Frequency Electronics [1]
This research focuses on the development of graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) capable of operating in the terahertz (THz) range. The main contribution and novelty of this work is a new substrate transfer method that significantly reduces impurities on the graphene sheet. This purification results in much higher electron mobility, which has been a major obstacle in creating practical high-frequency graphene electronics. The paper suggests this breakthrough could pave the way for next-generation communication systems. A potential research gap could be the scalability and cost-effectiveness of this new fabrication technique for mass production.

## Synthesized Overview

A significant recent application of graphene in electronics is the development of ultra-high-frequency transistors. Researchers have engineered graphene-based transistors that can operate at terahertz speeds, a critical step for next-generation wireless communication [1]. This was achieved by developing a novel fabrication process that enhances the material's electron mobility, overcoming a long-standing challenge in the field [1].
