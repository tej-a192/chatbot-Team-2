🔥 Alpha: The Last Stand
In a world torn apart by war and greed, there was one name whispered in fear across enemy lines — Alpha.

No one knew his real name. He was a shadow in the smoke, a ghost in the battlefield. But everyone recognized the sound of his gun — a custom-forged, matte black AR-95 Vulcan, engraved with a single word: “JUSTICE.”

⚔️ The Siege of Ironfall
It began at dawn. The skies over Ironfall were painted with fire as drone swarms blackened the horizon. Enemy forces — the Crimson Blight — surrounded the mountain city. Thousands of mercenaries, machines, and mutant enforcers closed in, ready to wipe out the last human resistance.

Alpha stood alone on the high ridge. Below him, the valley buzzed with tanks and foot soldiers. Beside him, the AR-95 Vulcan gleamed in the morning light.

He whispered to the gun like an old friend, “Let’s do what we do best.”

💥 Unleashing the Storm
Alpha moved like lightning.

First, he took out the sniper tower with a triple burst — three heads, one breath.

Then he sprinted through smoke and rubble, his Vulcan roaring like a dragon.

Enemies fell before they even realized he was there — perfect shots, every time.

His gun wasn’t just a weapon — it was an extension of his soul. Recoil? Nonexistent. Jams? Never. It hummed with precision, its smart-scope syncing perfectly with his eyes. In Alpha’s hands, the Vulcan was poetry in motion — deadly, fast, and unrelenting.

🧠 Tactics Over Terror
The enemy outnumbered him 200-to-1.

Didn’t matter.

Alpha hacked a dropship mid-battle, redirected airstrikes, and lured tanks into a canyon rigged with explosives. He fought like a strategist, not just a soldier.

But when the final wave came — the Crimson Juggernaut, a cybernetic monster 12 feet tall, armor like battleship steel — Alpha didn’t flinch.

He loaded the last clip.

Armor-piercing. Hollow point. One shot.

BOOM.

Straight through the eye socket. The beast crumbled.

🏁 The Aftermath
By nightfall, the battlefield was silent.

Only Alpha stood.

Smoke curled from the barrel of the AR-95. His armor was torn, but his resolve was iron.

He looked down at the broken insignia of the Crimson Blight, then raised his gun to the sky.

“This is what justice looks like.”

Then he vanished into the darkness, leaving only scorched earth and broken enemies behind.

🎯 The Legend Lives On
To this day, they say when war drums echo and thunder rolls across the hills, somewhere out there, Alpha is watching…

And his gun is locked, loaded, and ready.
