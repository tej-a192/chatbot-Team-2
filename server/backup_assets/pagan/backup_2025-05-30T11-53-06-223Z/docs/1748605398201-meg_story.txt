Meguri's Journey

Meguri was a quiet, thoughtful girl who lived in a small coastal village nestled between forested cliffs and the endless ocean. While others fished or farmed, Meguri was fascinated by the tides—not for their bounty, but for the messages they seemed to whisper.

One morning, after a storm, she found a piece of driftwood carved with strange symbols. Intrigued, she followed the tide’s pull, believing it was guiding her somewhere. Every morning, the sea left her a new piece—wood, shell, or bone—each inscribed with markings she slowly began to understand.

As months passed, Meguri deciphered a story: of a long-lost people, swallowed by the sea, whose knowledge was scattered by the waves, waiting to be remembered. Driven by purpose, she crafted a map from the fragments and followed it to a hidden cove. There, beneath the cliffs, she discovered an ancient shrine.

Inside was silence—but Meguri smiled. She had found what the sea wanted to show her: not treasure, but connection—to the past, to nature, and to her own deep intuition.

From that day, villagers called her “Meguri the Listener,” and whenever the tide changed, they asked her what the sea had to say.
